# Shared Modules

Reusable functions for APS GenAI Firewall scripts.

- PowerShell modules (`*.psm1`)
- Python libraries (`*.py`)

Governance:
- Shared modules should be generic and **not tied to a single product**.
- Changes require review from at least one sharedâ€‘modules CODEOWNER.
- Versioning / breaking changes must be documented in `docs/migration-evidence.md`.
